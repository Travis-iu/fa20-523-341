# Music Mood Classification

## Introduction
The overall mood of a musical piece is generally very difficult to decipher due to the highly subjective nature of music. One person might think a song is energetic and happy, while another may think it is quite sad. I know from my own experience that often I have listened to a seemingly uplifting song. Then later when reading the lyrics, I realize its quite depressing. As a result, previous studies take three different ways in classifying the mood of a song according to various mood models by analyzing audio, analyzing lyrics, and analyzing lyrics and audio. Most of these studies have been successful in their goals but have use a limited collection of songs/words for their analysis[1][2]. Seemingly obvious, the best results come when combining audio and lyrics.
